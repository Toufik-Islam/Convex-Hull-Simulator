\section{Introduction}

Convex hull algorithms are fundamental components in computational geometry with extensive applications across various domains including computer graphics, pattern recognition, image processing, and geographic information systems (GIS). A convex hull is defined as the smallest convex polygon that encloses all points in a given set, conceptually similar to stretching a rubber band around the outermost points.

Despite their critical importance in computational geometry, understanding and visualizing these algorithms can be challenging for students and professionals due to their abstract mathematical nature and complex geometric operations. Traditional learning methods through textbooks and static diagrams often fail to provide the intuitive understanding necessary to grasp the step-by-step execution of these algorithms.

This project addresses this educational gap by developing an interactive Convex Hull Algorithm Visualizer that provides a comprehensive platform for understanding, visualizing, and comparing multiple convex hull algorithms. The visualizer serves as both an educational tool for students learning computational geometry and a practical utility for professionals working with geometric algorithms.

The significance of this project lies in its ability to transform abstract algorithmic concepts into tangible, interactive experiences. By providing real-time visualization of algorithm execution, step-by-step animation, and performance comparison capabilities, this tool bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical understanding.
